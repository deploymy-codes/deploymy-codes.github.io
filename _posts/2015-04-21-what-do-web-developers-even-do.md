## What Do Web Developers Even Do?
 
Web developers are the most important part of the ecommerce industry, as without web developers there would be no ecommerce industry!
 
The best web developers will normally have substantial knowledge of the theoretical and practical sides of at least a couple of programming languages.  Your area of expertise will depend on whether or not you are a front end developer or a back end developer.  However a knowledge of both front and backend programming languages would always be an advantage.
 
Below is a list of common web development languages:
-Ruby on Rails
-C++
-C#
-Java
-Python
-Javascript
-PHP
-Scala
-CSS
-HTML
-SQL
-Angular.js
-JQUERY


## General Skills Required by a Developer
- Attention to detail, as if a character of your code is wrong, your application will not work.
- Team working skills.  This is essential, as in some companies web developers work with a large range of different people.  For example, there will be web designers who will design the front end of an application, which a web developer will then have to create based on this specification.  A company may also have a professional tester, who will then test the application, and will give you feedback which you must take into account when completing the final version.
- Commercial awareness.  Awareness of the commercial purpose of the application you are building will help you to fully understand how it needs to function.  Commercial awareness will also enable you to make suggestions and improvements to the application in order for it to better achieve the objective it is being built to achieve.
- Communication skills.  Many companies now use instant messaging services, as well as email.  So awareness of services such as Skype instant messenger and Slack would be useful.
 
 
## Entry Requirements
The below is guide, and will vary depending on employer.
 
There are no official entry requirements.  The only real entry requirement is an ability to demonstrate your ability to code.  One way to do this would be through academic qualifications such as a degree.  The advantage of a degree is that it proves you have a certain level of knowledge at a universally recognised standard.  
 
However another way to prove your knowledge of web development is to create and maintain your own website.  Doing so can also show an awareness of online marketing and usability.  A personal website is also an interesting thing to talk about in an interview.
 
## Responsibilities
It would be very difficult to provide a list of common responsibilities of web developers, because they work in such a broad and varied environment.
 
However two broad distinctions that can generally be draw are those developers who work for digital agencies and developers who work client side.
 
### Agency-side
- Maintain effective and regular contact with the client to ensure that the brief you are working to is the brief that the client wants.
- Learn about the client’s exiting systems to ensure that what you build will fit seamlessly into the client’s system at the point of implementation
- You must also try to ensure that whatever you build does not break or adversely affect the client’s system when they make changes in the future.
 
### Client-side
- Scaling up databases and other website performance measures to ensure a website can handle increased periods of traffic, such as Christmas.
 
### Tasks common to all developers
- Using Github as a project management tool – and in particular becoming familiar with pull requests, pull reviews, forking etc.
- Devising tests to ensure that the code you create will both do it’s job correctly and not break any other applications on the site.
- Become familiar with the deployment pipline of each individual client or the company you work for.  There are a number of ways to deploy code.  One way to deploy code is through continuous deployment using a technology such as codeship.  Another alternative would be to use a more manual system.  The disadvantage of this system is that this leaves space for human errors.
- You must also be comfortable deploying your code to the staging environment, testing it to make sure it doesn’t break anything, and then deploying to the production server (the real thing)!
 
 
## Career Progression and Development
There are a variety of different ways to do this, and it does not have to involve paid education.
 
One way to go about improving your CV is to learn another programming language, and this can be done using sites such as www.codecademy.com, www.codeschool.com/ and www.teamtreehouse.com/
 
It is also a good idea to join in any local development language user groups.  This can be a great place to share ideas and meet more senior developers that you can learn from.
 
Examples of such groups include:

## Salary
The figures below are a rough guide.  A web developer’s salary will vary depending on the country and region that she/he works in.  However as a guide:
 
- An entry level web developer could earn as much as £22,000
- A web developer with a few years of experience could expect to earn between £25,000 and £35,000.
- Lead developers and CTO’s could expect to earn £35,000 and above.

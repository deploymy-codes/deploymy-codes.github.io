## Why We Need To Automate Manual Deployment
 
DeployMy.Codes is leading the revolution in automated manual deployment.  Our innovative interface provides an easy and efficient way for both technical people and non-techincal people to deploy code
 
The largest benefit of the automated deployment capability provided by DeployMy.Codes, is that developers no longer make mistakes when deploying.
 
Once the anxiety of making mistakes in deployment is gone, developers are free to make more deployments, therefore allowing developers to work more efficiently.
 
DeployMy.Codes also allows non-technical members of an online team to make deployments.  This means that less technically savvy team members can deploy code that is most important to their work flow.
 
For example, the marketing team might need a bug fix for the CMS to continue doing important work.  With DMC, non-technical marketing personnel can deploy the fixes that they need, without asking the developers to do it for them.  Consequently, both developers and non-technical members of the online team can work more efficiently.
 
Another advantage of automated manual deployment is that it is often faster.  Therefore using DeployMy.Codes will help you to get through technical tickets faster.
 
Further, automated manual deployment will rid you of discrepancies in deployment between your different environments.  Therefore DMC can help keep your deployment environments consistent 
 
DeployMy.Codes will identify and record who deployed what, where and when.  Therefore you no longer need to keep time-consuming deployment records
 
With DeployMy.Codes, the pain of sharing deployment passwords is history.  Each member of the online team will have their own login.
 
There are a variety of reasons to automate manual deployment.  [Click here to become a BETA tester of our manual deployment.](http://www.deploymy.codes/)

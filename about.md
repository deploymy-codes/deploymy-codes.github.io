Hello from DeployMy.Codes!

DeployMy.Codes is an application that allows web developers greater freedom over the deployment of their code.

How DMC can benefit Developers

DeployMy.Codes takes the hassle out of manual deployment.   DeployMy.Codes will allow you to deploy different commits when you feel comfortable in doing so.

How DMC can benefit CTO's

Our interface will provide you with a list of deploys that are ready to be deployed to production.  You can decide exactly which deploys you want to push/test, without having to trouble your developers to do it manually for you.

This means that you can leave your developers to concentrate on coding, while you deploy the code that you feel has the highest priority, therefore increasing the overall efficiency of your department.

How DMC can benefit Marketing Personnel

Our interface will provide you with all the bug fixes and new features that your developers have finished.  Consequently you will no longer have to nag your developers to deploy certain releases.  You will have the power to deploy features and fixes that are most important to you and your work flow.
